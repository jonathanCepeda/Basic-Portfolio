          <p>
            I study digital systems and robotics because I have always had a passion for solving problems with 
            logic, I like to spend hours or even days thinking and trying to find the best or most efficient way 
            to do something and I always enjoy a good challenge, and I think it’s harder and more stressful to 
            work on tedious or monotonous tasks, than trying to solve a complex problem. 
          </p>

            My favorite areas of study are digital systems, automation, and computer vision. I would like to work 
            in one of those areas doing research, especially in computer vision. I am currently working as a 
            full-time embedded software engineer at John Deere.

            Outside of education, I enjoy traveling, doing road trips around Mexico, solving logic puzzles and 
            brain teasers, woodworking, football (soccer), hiking and nature in general, I think one of the best 
            feelings in the world is reaching the top of a mountain and enjoying the view, that’s why I chose this 
            picture.
